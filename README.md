# Sys2Syz

## Overview

Sys2Syz is a tool which can be used to convert Syscalls and other Ioctl calls to [syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) representation. This tool is developed for the NetBSD Operating system and is done as a part of Google Summer of Code 2020 project with the NetBSD Foundation.

## Working
The tool supports generation of syzkaller descriptions for NetBSD device driver's ioctl calls. Following steps are involved:

- Extraction of all ioctl commands of a given device driver along with their arguments.
- Preprocessing of the device driver's files using compile_commands.json
- Generates descriptions for the calls and their arguments (builtin-types, arrays, pointers, structures and unions) using the XML files (XML files are generated by running c2xml on preprocessed device files).

## Installation
#### Prerequisites:
---
- [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) setup
- [NetBSD src](https://github.com/NetBSD/src) files

#### Build on Linux:
---
- Clone the repo
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz.git
 cd sys2syz
 ```
- Run the setup script
  ```shell
  ./setup.sh -b <path_to_netbsd_src>
  ```
## Features

- Fetches ioctl calls of a particular device driver.
- Generates a file having syzkaller specific descriptions for fetched ioctl calls.

## TODO

Features yet to be implemented:
- Generation of syzkaller descriptions for syscalls.
- Generation of descriptions for functions, passed as arguments to syscalls.
